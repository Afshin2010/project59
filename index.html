            In my free time my favorite hobby is just to be reasearching about random stuff. I usually like to research about astrology and cosmology. I usually do this everyday about 30 mins before I got to online school because of COVID19. I am 11 years old and I am in the top of my class. I feel like for me researching is calming and keeps my brain sharp in the morning. It also makes you smarter everyday. I think its a very good habbit to get. I got this habbit mostly cause I always have a question and I just go to google and reasearch away.

            <h2>
                Stuff I learned
            </h2>
            <p>
                I like to learn a lot of stuff everyday. That is why I like to do a lot of research on all diferent stuff. Here are some stuff that I learned from doing research.
            </p>
            <h1>
                Space
            </h1>
            <p>
                For space I do the most research that I can. Some things I learned from researching about Space are different asteriods charging earth at an alarming rate and people finally gong to Mars.
            </p>
            <h1>
                Random
            </h1>
            <p>
                Sometimes I also like to just search about random stuff on my mind for example what coledges are the best and what stuff are on ceartain stuff or just try to learn something new.
